                <h2>AHP-Based Supplier Selection System</h2>
                <p>
                  In the competitive world of retail, especially in the food staple sector like rice, choosing the right supplier can make or break a business. This project originated from a real challenge faced by Toko Beras Madura, a rice retail store operating in a densely populated market area. 
                  While demand was consistently high, the store struggled to select rice suppliers who could offer both competitive pricing and high product quality. Without a proper evaluation system, the decision-making process became subjective and inconsistent — leading to customer dissatisfaction and reduced profit margins.
                  To address this, I proposed and developed a Decision Support System (DSS) using the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) method. The system helps evaluate and rank potential suppliers based on criteria such as price, quality, delivery time, and reliability.
                </p>
                  <h2>My Role in This Project</h2>
                <p>
                  IThroughout this project, I was fully involved in the end-to-end process, from analyzing system needs to designing both the database and user interface flow.
                  Here’s what I worked on:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Understanding business problems:</strong> I studied how the rice retail business selects its suppliers and identified the key pain points that needed to be solved.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Modeling system behavior:</strong> I created various UML diagrams — such as use case, activity, sequence, and class diagrams — to illustrate how the system should operate based on user needs.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Designing the database structure:</strong> I developed a complete Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) to define how the data would be stored and connected logically, with proper relationships to support the AHP method.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Building a scalable data model:</strong> I structured the tables to support comparisons, scoring, and decision ranking in a way that’s ready for implementation.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Visualizing the interface:</strong> I also designed simple wireframes to simulate how users would interact with the system when evaluating suppliers.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Challenges Faced & How I Overcame Them</h2>
                <p>
                 One of the biggest challenges I faced during this project was figuring out how to turn a real-world business issue into a structured system design. As a student, I didn’t have prior experience with formal system modeling, so learning how to choose and create the right UML diagrams took a lot of trial and error.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Another difficulty was designing the database structure to support the AHP method. I had to think beyond just storing data — I needed to make sure the structure could handle pairwise comparisons, weighting, and result calculation in a logical and scalable way.
                </p>
                <p>
                  To overcome these, I did a lot of research, looked at example systems, and broke the work into smaller parts. I started by focusing on one table at a time, validating each step, and continuously testing whether the flow made sense for the end user. It was challenging, but also one of the most rewarding learning processes in my academic journey.
                </p>

                <h2>Takeaway</h2>
                <p>
                  <i>“What mattered wasn’t how much I knew at the start, but how willing I was to figure things out along the way."</i>
                </p>
                <p>I didn’t start this project as an expert, but by breaking down the problem, doing research, and staying curious, I ended up understanding more than I thought I could. This experience showed me how much we can learn by just starting and figuring things out along the way.</p>
