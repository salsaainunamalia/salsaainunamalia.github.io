              <h3>Why I Designed the Data Flow in This Way</h3>
              <p>
                I built the ERD from scratch by analyzing the system requirements and aligning them with the use case design. The structure was created to ensure clear data relationships, minimize redundancy, and support scalability for future enhancements. Each entity and relationship was carefully mapped to reflect real system interactions, making the database not only efficient but also adaptable to potential upgrades as the project evolves.

                <h2>Designing a Role-Based Login System for Asset Management</h2>
                <p>
                  This project was initiated to address inefficiencies in the company’s asset management process. Previously, asset tracking and recording were done manually, which often led to errors, inconsistencies, and difficulties in locating or transferring assets. There was no proper record of asset transfers, making it harder for both IT and General Affairs (GA) to monitor equipment such as PCs, networks, desks, and chairs.
                </p>
                <p>
                  During the early stages, I faced several challenges due to a lack of coordination within my IT team. For more than a month, I did not receive clear direction or briefing from my leader or IT support, which caused delays. Additionally, my leader often emphasized only technical issues and “the simplest way out,” without considering user convenience. To ensure the system truly helps users, I decided to take initiative and consulted directly with the GA senior, who manages office assets daily. From these discussions, I identified the need for an Asset Transfer feature, which was not initially considered. I then integrated this feature into the system design so users could track asset movements more effectively.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This proactive approach helped shape a system that is not only technically functional but also user-friendly and aligned with real operational needs.
                </p>
                <h2>My Role in This Project</h2>
                <p>In this project, I was responsible for designing and developing the database structure to ensure data consistency, efficiency, and scalability. My main tasks included:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><b>Analyzing Requirements</b> – Interpreted business and system needs to translate them into logical database structures.</li>
                  <li><b>Designing ERD (Entity Relationship Diagram)</b> – Built the ERD as a blueprint for the database, defining entities, relationships, and constraints.</li>
                  <li><b>Creating Use Case Scenarios</b> – Developed use case diagrams to illustrate system interactions and data flows <i>(requested by front end)</i></li>
                  <li><b>Database Implementation.</b> – Converted ERD into a physical database using MySQL, ensuring normalization and optimized queries</li>
                  <li><b>Collaboration & Documentation</b> – Worked closely with the team to align database design with application requirements and documented all design decisions.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This role strengthened my skills in database administration, system analysis, and problem-solving, while also improving my ability to communicate technical concepts to both technical and non-technical stakeholders.</p

                <h2>Takeaway</h2>
                <p>
                  <i>"Difficulties in life are meant to push us forward, not hold us back. Sometimes, lack of support becomes the reason we discover our own strength"</i>
                </p>
                <p>In this project, I learned that building a system is not just about technical simplicity but about making it truly practical and useful for end-users. By taking the initiative to step outside of my team and directly engage with the General Affairs team, I was able to design a solution that addressed real needs. Despite limited guidance from my IT support and leader, I pushed the project forward with resilience and responsibility. Most importantly, I realized that challenges can actually spark greater creativity and innovation when approached with the right mindset.</p>
